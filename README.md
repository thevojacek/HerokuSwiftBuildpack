# Heroku Swift Buildpack

This is a simple and straightforward buildpack for Heroku cloud environment to deploy your Swift applications with ease!

## Compatibility

Currently, this buildpack is tested and working on a newest heroku stack, "**heroku-18**", which is based on Ubuntu 18.04. Older stacks probably won't work.

If you need to upgrade your Heroku stack, there is an easy to follow [tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/upgrading-to-the-latest-stack) on Heroku's website.

## Usage
You may, specify a specific release of Swift you want to install by including **.swift-version** file in the home directory of your app. If you don't specify a version, it defaults to the "**4.2.1**" release at the moment.

```shell
-rw-r--r--@  1 name  staff    41B  6 pro 19:48 .gitignore
-rw-r--r--@  1 name  staff     5B  7 pro 17:14 .swift-version
cat .swift-version
4.2.1
```

**All you need to do is just to add the buildpack to your Heroku application and push a new release like so:**

```shell
heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/thevojacek/HerokuSwiftBuildpack.git
git push heroku master
```
