# Heroku Swift Buildpack

This is a simple and straightforward buildpack for Heroku cloud environment to deploy your Swift applications with ease!
This buildpacks automatically install specified version of Swift and Clang and builds your application!

## Compatibility

Currently, this buildpack is tested and working on a newest heroku stack, "**heroku-18**", which is based on Ubuntu 18.04. Older stacks probably won't work.

If you need to upgrade your Heroku stack, there is an easy to follow [tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/upgrading-to-the-latest-stack) on Heroku's website.

**It only works with Swift application which are using Swift Package Manager.** So your app will be detected and buildpack used only if your app contains **Package.swift** file in it's root directory.

## Usage

### Specify a Swift version
You may, specify a specific release of Swift you want to install by including **.swift-version** file in the home directory of your app. If you don't specify a version, it defaults to the "**4.2.1**" release at the moment.

```shell
$ ls -la
-rw-r--r--@  1 name  staff    41B  6 pro 19:48 .gitignore
-rw-r--r--@  1 name  staff     5B  7 pro 17:14 .swift-version
...

$ cat .swift-version
4.2.1
```

### Procfile
Also, you **must** specify a Procfile for Heroku to determine, which process you want to run. Name of the process should equal to target name specified in your **Package.swift** file.

```shell
$ ls -la
-rw-r--r--@  1 name  staff   681B 10 pro 19:26 Package.swift
-rw-r--r--@  1 name  staff    21B  9 pro 15:25 Procfile
...

$ cat Procfile
web: ./Application
```

### Example usage
**All you need to do is just to add the buildpack to your Heroku application and push a new release like so:**

```shell
$ ls
Procfile Package.swift Sources
...

$ heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/thevojacek/HerokuSwiftBuildpack.git

$ git push heroku master
...
```
